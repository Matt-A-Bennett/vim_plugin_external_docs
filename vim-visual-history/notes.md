# Ideas for improvements/features

 - To figure out why the non-motion approaches I've tried so far don't work,
   make an entirely separate record of the things I capture when leaving
   visual. Remap `[v` and `]v` to traverse *that* list and see if its working.
   Then maybe I can simply concatenate the lists (or just check the
   separately).

 - Maybe I need to set b:reselecting to 4, and subtract one each time to
   protect the thing..
